# Beatcaps Sample

This is a sample way to use Beatcaps for imagining music

Closed captions listener: you can copy and paste it from here: https://github.com/goatandsheep/closed-captions-listener or install it from NPM here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/caption-sync (docs created)

I'm live updating this README during this competition.

Some example effects I've created:

* Video shake: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-jitter (docs WIP) 
* Colour randomizer: https://www.npmjs.com/package/rainbow-paint ([docs](https://github.com/goatandsheep/color-randomizer))
* Vibrate toggle: https://npmjs.com/package/piez ([docs](https://github.com/goatandsheep/vibrate-toggle))

Hardware component:

* [ViGEm](https://github.com/ViGEm/) (not mine)
* Example ViGEm (WIP)

## Testing

To test locally you'll need to do something funky or risk that browsers think local closed captions files are insecure.

1. Run the following command in the root folder of this project:

```shell
npx http-server
```

2. Open server [on port 80](http://localhost:8080)
